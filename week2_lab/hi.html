     My name is Putera Niq Aziz. This my page for the week 2 laboratory assignment of web programming course. Well, web programming is not a new thing for me and it is one of my favourite in terms of project development. At this page, i will describe about myself in a short introduction on my favourite places, pictures and my computing skills.</p>

<p>Short introduction to myself, I am a person with a very positive personality plus I'm also highly open minded new facts and thoughts. I love details in every of my works and I'm highly adheres to my own principles and rules of life. My life principles is that everything must have their/its own standard, know your standard and stay within your standard. I always keep to one rules which is to earn something, we need to do it the hard way which will always lead to discovery of what you need to know through experience or by making mistakes. With all this principles and rules, it always bring me to one or more steps ahead of the others as it makes me less afraid in making mistakes and from all those mistakes, I learn and adapt faster than the others.</p>

<p>Personally, i prefer keeping my companions in a small circles as I am more to quality over quantity. I'm also able starts a conversation to strangers and I loves jokes from other and sometimes even a small jokes will be able to make me laugh. That's all from me, hopefully we could meet in person. Thank you for your time.
